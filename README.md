Buffer & print periodic table file|lines

## TODO
- Add periodic table file rows for all elements
- Iterate read() to allow full buffering when file system data is unavailable
- Allow searches or commands
  - Known industrial or other uses
  - Quantum models or at least electron configuration(s) per element
  - Atomic weights, masses, and earthly proportions
  - Applicable formulae
  - Reaction tables or simulations
  - Of course more but consider using a separate program with a database for more complicated information?
